# PriceOptima — Dynamic Pricing System

This README defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to evaluate PriceOptima, the dynamic pricing system. The KPIs measure revenue, profitability, customer response, and inventory efficiency to ensure pricing decisions drive healthy business outcomes.

## 1. Revenue Lift

Revenue Lift measures the percentage increase in total revenue after implementing the dynamic pricing system compared to the baseline (static pricing strategy).

**How it is measured**  
Compare total revenue during the baseline period (static pricing) with total revenue during the dynamic pricing period.

```
Revenue Lift (%) = ((Revenue_after_dynamic_pricing - Revenue_baseline) / Revenue_baseline) * 100
```

Revenue maximization is the primary objective of a dynamic pricing system. This KPI directly evaluates whether the pricing recommendations lead to higher sales value (not just volume).

**Expected Target**  
8–12% increase in revenue after implementing dynamic pricing.

## 2. Profit Margin Improvement

Profit Margin Improvement evaluates the change in profit margin per product and overall after applying optimized pricing strategies.

**How it is measured**  
Profit margin is calculated per product or in aggregate as:


```
Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue
```

Track the change in profit margin between the baseline and dynamic-pricing periods.

Dynamic pricing should not increase revenue at the cost of profitability. This KPI ensures pricing decisions respect cost constraints and margin thresholds.

**Expected Target**  
3–6% improvement in overall profit margins.

## 3. Conversion Rate


Conversion Rate represents the percentage of customers who purchase a product after a price change is applied.

**How it is measured**  
Measure conversions relative to demand signals (e.g., product views or purchase opportunities):


```
Conversion Rate = Units Sold / Number of Product Views (or demand instances)
```

Track conversion rate before and after price changes and measure the percent change.

This KPI helps understand customer price sensitivity and ensures that price increases do not significantly reduce demand or customer trust.

**Expected Target**  
Maintain conversion rate within ±2–5% variation after price changes.

## 4. Inventory Turnover


Inventory Turnover measures how frequently inventory is sold and replaced over a given period after dynamic pricing is applied.

**How it is measured**  

```
Inventory Turnover = Units Sold / Average Inventory
```

Compare turnover rates between baseline and dynamic-pricing periods.


Dynamic pricing should help reduce excess stock and prevent stockouts, improving operational efficiency and cash flow.

**Expected Target**  
10–15% improvement in inventory turnover.

These KPIs collectively ensure the dynamic pricing system:

- Increases revenue
- Maintains or improves profitability
- Preserves customer demand and trust
- Optimizes inventory movement

They provide a balanced evaluation framework covering both business performance and customer impact.
